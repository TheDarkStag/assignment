                <h1>Who am i </h1>
                My name is Akinbile Abdulmumeen, a recent graduate of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta,
                 where I earned a degree in Computer Science. Currently,
                 I am embarking on the initial stages of my National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), 
                 reflecting on the journey that has brought me to this point and the aspirations that drive me forward.
                My fascination with technology and the internet has been a guiding force throughout my academic journey.
                 From the early days of exploring the basics of computer science to delving into the intricacies of how the internet functions, 
                 I have been captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offers.
                <br>

                 <h1>Why tech?</h1>
                Throughout my time at university, I seized every opportunity to expand my understanding of technology and 
                its applications.Despite facing challenges and financial constraints that limited my exploration, 
                my passion for learning and sharing knowledge remained unwavering. Although our education was primarily theory-based, lacking hands-on experience,
                I became aware of the vast potential within the tech industry. This realization piqued my interest in various domains,
                 from web development to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity—the latter being my initial inspiration for pursuing computer science.
                One aspect of technology that has particularly intrigued me is the role of individuals behind the scenes—the innovators, creators,
                 and entrepreneurs who drive the digital revolution forward.
                <br>
                <h1>Why Altschool?</h1>
                <p>My curiosity about these individuals and their impact on the digital landscape motivates me to pursue further education and opportunities for growth.
                My decision to join Alt School Africa's School of Engineering, with a focus on front-end development, stems from a desire to gain practical skills and hands-on experience. 
                Alt School's innovative approach to education, emphasizing collaborative problem-solving and real-world applications, aligns perfectly with my aspirations. 
                I am eager to immerse myself in this dynamic learning environment, refining my technical skills while honing my ability to think critically, communicate effectively, and adapt to evolving technologies.
                Alt School Africa's commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive community of learners resonates deeply with me. As a nation with over 250 ethnic groups and countless languages,
                 Nigeria understands the importance of embracing diversity and celebrating our differences. At Alt School, I look forward to collaborating with peers from diverse backgrounds, 
                 learning from experienced mentors, and contributing to a vibrant learning community.
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I am deeply invested in giving back to my community and empowering future generations of Nigerian technologists. 
                While I may be a beginner myself, I am eager to share my knowledge and experiences with others. As a mentor and advocate for STEM education,
                 I am committed to inspiring and supporting others on their own journeys in technology.
                Studying front-end engineering at Alt School Africa represents a new beginning for me—a chance to pursue my passion, expand my horizons, 
                and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. With its innovative approach to education, commitment to diversity and inclusion, 
                and emphasis on hands-on learning, Alt School Africa embodies everything I value in an educational institution. 
                I am confident that my time at Alt School will equip me with the skills and knowledge necessary to contribute meaningfully to Nigeria's tech ecosystem and beyond.
                <p>I am excited about the opportunity to explore new frontiers, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to projects that have the potential to make a real difference in the world. Furthermore, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and empowering others through education. Whether through volunteering, teaching, or mentorship programs, I see myself playing a role in shaping the future of technology and education in Africa.
                Thank you for considering my application.
