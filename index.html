                My name is Akinbile Abdulmumeen, a recent graduate of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta,
                where I earned a degree in Computer Science. Currently,
                I am embarking on the initial stages of my National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),
                reflecting on the journey that has brought me to this point and the aspirations that drive me forward.
                My fascination with technology and the internet has been a guiding force throughout my academic journey.
                From the early days of exploring the basics of computer science to delving into the intricacies of how
                the
                internet functions,
                I have been captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. i am also a big fan of
                movies games and music.
                i play basketball as an hobby and i enjoy taling to people.

            <h1 id="who2"> "why choose tech as a career path"?</h1>
            <p>
                Ever since I was a child, I've been deeply fascinated by science and the mysteries of the world around
                me. I was the type of kid who asked endless questions, trying to understand how things worked. This
                curiosity led me to explore different areas of science, but it was when I encountered computers that
                everything truly clicked. The way they operated, the logic behind them, and their ability to solve
                complex problems fascinated me beyond anything else. It was like discovering a new language, one that
                could be used to create, innovate, and explore endless possibilities. From that moment on, I knew that
                whatever path I chose in life, it would have to involve computers.

                This passion for technology naturally led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Throughout my time
                at university, I seized every opportunity to deepen my understanding of how technology shapes the world.
                Despite facing challenges, such as limited access to resources and financial constraints, my drive to
                learn and share knowledge never wavered. Even though our education was largely theory-based, I
                recognized the immense potential within the tech industry, particularly in areas like web development,
                artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity—the latter being my initial inspiration for pursuing this
                field.
            </p>

            <p>
                I delved deeper into the tech world, I had the privilege of meeting and learning from several
                remarkable individuals in the industry. Their journeys were incredibly inspiring. I remember one person
                who shared how they used technology to solve real-world problems, making a tangible difference in their
                community. Another spoke about transforming a simple idea into a thriving startup, showing that with
                determination, creativity, and a little bit of risk-taking, anything is possible in tech. These
                encounters fueled my ambition, making me realize that I, too, wanted to create something meaningful,
                something that could impact others.

                I am driven by the desire to carve out my own space in the tech industry. I want to have a name and a
                purpose, to be part of the digital revolution that's shaping our future. Whether it's through developing
                innovative solutions, contributing to groundbreaking research, or even inspiring the next generation of
                tech enthusiasts, I am committed to playing my part. The tech world is vast and full of opportunities,
                and I am eager to find my place within it, to leave a lasting mark, and to be part of something greater
                than myself.
